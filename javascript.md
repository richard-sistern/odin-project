# JavaScript

## Fundamentals

### Variables

*Notes from [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/variables)*

Declaring a variable in JavaScript has changed from `var` to `let` and `const`.

```javascript
let message = 'Hello!'; // define the variable and assign the value

alert(message); // Hello!
```

Being a "constant" just means that a variableâ€™s value never changes. But there are constants (A_CONSTANT_NAME) that are known prior to execution (like a hexadecimal value for red) and there are constants (aConstantName) that are *calculated* in run-time, during the execution, but do not change after their initial assignment.
